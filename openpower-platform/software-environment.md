# Software Environment

## HPC Software Stack

The HPC Software stack is made of the following software packages:

| Category | Software Package | Current Version |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Compilers / Runtimes | CUDA Toolkit | 10.1 |
|  | GCC \[System\] | 4.8 |
|  | GCC \[Advance Toolchain 12.0\] | 8.3 |
|  | IBM XL C/C++ & Fortran | 16.1 |
|  | PGI Accelerator | 2020 |
| MPI Library | IBM Spectrum MPI | 10.3 |
| Scientific Libraries | IBM ESSL | 6.2 |
|  | IBM Parallel ESSL | 5.4 |
| Performance Analysis | IBM Parallel Performance Toolkit | 2.4 |

> IBM XL C/C++ is fully compatible with the C++ 11 standard.
>
> IBM Spectrum MPI \(based on Open MPI 2.0\) has become the default choice for MPI library starting from Q4 2016. IBM Parallel Environment has therefore been discontinued.
