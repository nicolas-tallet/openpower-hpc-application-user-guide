# Software Environment

## HPC Software Stack

The HPC Software stack is made of the following software packages:

| Category             | Software Package               | Current Version

> IBM XL C/C++ is fully compatible with the C++ 11 standard.

> IBM Spectrum MPI (based on Open MPI 2.0) has become the default choice for MPI library starting from Q4 2016. IBM Parallel Environment has therefore been discontinued.
