# Software Environment

## HPC Software Stack

The HPC Software stack is made of the following software packages:

| Category | Software Package | Current Version |

| Compilers | CUDA Toolkit | 8.0 |
|  | GCC \[Standard\] | 4.8 |
|  | GCC \[Advance Toolchain 9.0\] | 5.4 |
|  | GCC \[Advance Toolchain 10.0\] | 6.3 |
|  | GCC \[Advance Toolchain 11.0\] | 7.2 |
|  | IBM XL C/C++ | 13.1.5 |
|  |  | 13.1.6 \(Beta 11\) |
|  | IBM XL Fortran | 15.1.5 |
|  |  | 15.1.6 \(Beta 11\) |
|  | LLVM Clang | Beta |
|  | LLVM XLFlang | Beta |
|  | PGI Accelerator | 17.07 |
|  |  | 17.09 |
| MPI Library | IBM Spectrum MPI | 10.1 |
| Scientific Libraries | IBM ESSL | 5.5 |
|  | IBM PESSL | 5.3 |
| Performance Analysis | IBM Parallel Performance Toolkit for POWER | 2.3 |

> IBM XL C/C++ is fully compatible with the C++ 11 standard.
>
> IBM Spectrum MPI \(based on Open MPI 2.0\) has become the default choice for MPI library starting from Q4 2016.  
> IBM Parallel Environment has therefore been discontinued.
